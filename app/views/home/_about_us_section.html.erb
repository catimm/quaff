				<span class="about-us-text-emphais">Knird is a new breed</span> of “bottle shop”.  We don’t expect you to 
				adjust to us; <span class="about-us-text-emphais">we adjust to you</span>.  We make craft easier through 
				personalization, <span class="about-us-text-emphais">finding you the drinks that are worth your time</span>, 
				money and limited drinking opportunities.  Most craft drinks are not made to appeal to everyone.  
				So how do you find drinks you'll love <span class="about-us-text-emphais">without having to make craft 
				beer or cider a part time job</span>? Enter Knird.  <span class="about-us-text-emphais">
				We don’t put the burden on you</span> to figure out which of our “50 taps” or “thousands of bottles” you 
				<i>might</i> like to drink.  <span class="about-us-text-emphais">We make it simple</span>.

				We believe <span class="about-us-text-emphais">craft beer and cider should be easy</span> to navigate and 
				more accessible.  So we find <span class="about-us-text-emphais">truly great drinks</span> that match 
				your preferred tastes.  These drinks are <span class="about-us-text-emphais">delivered to you</span>, 
				and&mdash;unlike other delivery services&mdash;we stick <span class="about-us-text-emphais">with normal 
				prices</span> like you would find at any other local store.  We provide all this 
				<span class="about-us-text-emphais"><i>and</i> extra rewards</span> that help make it easier to get 
				limited and rare drinks.  Easy, simple, personalized. 
				<span class="about-us-text-emphais">That’s why we created Knird</span>.
