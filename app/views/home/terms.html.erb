				is utilized via our proprietary recommendation algorithm in consideration of input from both experts and 
				our community as a whole to find other beers and ciders you will find appealing.  This process is 
				completed for beers and ciders available in local retailers (“Retailers”) where Knird is monitoring 
				currently available drinks in order to present drinks to you in a stack ranked manner befitting your 
				personal taste preferences.</h5>
