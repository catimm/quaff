				<h4 class="early-signup-confirmation-text">Until then, just a few thoughts for you:</h4>
				<h4 class="early-signup-confirmation-text">
					<ul>
						<li>Your early signup earned you <%= @bottle_caps %> bottle caps (reward points). This is 
							enough to get you <%= @number_of_drinks %> if you chose. Cheers!</li>
						<li><b>Want more free drinks?</b> You can earn 30 bottle caps for each friend that joins&mdash;with at 
							least a 3-month membership&mdash;using your personal invitation code (<b><%= @user_invitation_code.special_code %></b>). To make this 
							easy, we've sent you an email that has info you can forward to invite others.</li>
						<li>As a reminder, when you signed up early, we charged you the full membership cost. However, 
							your <%= @user_subscription %>  membership will not officially begin until your first delivery 
							and you won't be billed extra for the time between now and then.</li>
						<li>Please <%= mail_to "questions@drinkknird.com", "contact us" %> with any questions you have!</li>
